A complete binary tree that combines the usefulness of both
a min-heap and a max-heap, providing constant time retrieval
and logarithmic time removal of both the minimum and maximum
elements in it.

This min-max heap includes methods to insert into the heap, 
find the minimum node in the heap, find the maximum node, 
remove the minimum node, remove the maximum node, and check 
whether the heap is a fulfills the required properties to be 
considered a min-max heap. It also includes thorough pytests 
to test whether the program works.
